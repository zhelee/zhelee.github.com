<div class="entry-content"><p>After being working in <a href="www.secondbureau.com">SecondBureau</a> for 1 year, I
learned a lot things, this post is about my experience in this company.</p>

<p>Something I want to mention at the beginning of this post:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am Chinese, worked in the Chinese comapny before I enter this French
company</li>
<li>I used Java as main language before, and I use Ruby in the current company</li>
<li>I used Microsoft Windows before, and now I use xubuntu in company</li>
</ol>


<p>Now I am more and more clear how to be a good and successful coder, I think if I
didn&#8217;t enther the current company, I don&#8217;t know how much time it will take to
let me known how to become a better coder, becuase what I learned in the past
year in the current company is even more than the last 3 years before the
previous year.</p>

<p>Here I want to share some of tips those I learned in the past year.</p>

<p><strong>1. Write specification at the very beginning, and really thinking about the
needs.</strong> Some people say they are using <strong>Agile</strong> now, they don&#8217;t need specification, they
do it by iteration. I trust this before, but actually it&#8217;s wrong, because
<strong>Agile</strong> doesn&#8217;t mean without specification or any documents. My boss teach me to
write my first specification, after that I feel I am much more clear about the
needs, the specification has no relationship with the code, it only describes
the features, and let you think about how does the user want to use the software, and
what they want to do with it, with some work flow chart, we can know the
process. In this step, we would know how the user want to use the software and
some special needs. I think that&#8217;s enough, we write this basic specification and
meet the clients to talk with them , and make the specification better.</p>

<p><strong>2. Make plans for the day, the week, the month.</strong> If you are not clear about
your work for the day, just stop and think about it, if you can make a plan for
the next week, the next month, or even the next half year, everything will be
easier, why, because every second you know what you should do, and know what
kind of problems you might meet, and know how to fix the problem. Making plan is
really a thing which will cause you to think about future. Thinking about the
clients, maybe they will change their minds about the software, maybe we can
prepare something which we think they are needed in the future, maybe a big
overview about the next month. Making plan can let you have a good feeling about
future, and we can control it better, this means, less problems, more things
under control. Another point is we need adjust the plan by the end of the day,
the week, the month, through this we know the problem, and we can improve
ourselves or let us know better future.</p>

<p><strong>3. Charts and prototype.</strong>  Some of people like me don&#8217;t have sense with
charactors, but a picture can make us very clear about things in a minute. And
for colleage and client, it&#8217;s the same. Draw things when you think about the
working flow and the user interface. We can use some tools to draw it very
quickly, it really show the meanings. It make us easily understand each other,
especially for the clients.</p>

<p><strong>4.Talking with your colleages.</strong> Talk with your colleages can improve yourself
very fast. Maybe you are stucked with a problem, and you have been thinking for
2 hours, without any result. some people will continue, and some will ask. We
are working, not researching, so we need result as soon as possible, if it
already takes a lot of time, you need to ask, or communicate with others, maybe
others alreay know the solution, or maybe they have met something like that, it
will help you to fix the problem.</p>

<p><strong>5. Give feedback as soon as possible.</strong>  3 months ago, I made a big mistake.
After 3 weeks, I told the boss I want to change the way to implement the
feature. It&#8217;s really very bad. 2 points here, why do you want to change the way and
why do you want to change after 3 weeks. Let&#8217;s focus on the second question. The
first one is caused by the second one. Why do you want to change after 3 weeks,
it should not happen if you give feedback as soon as possible. Others can
evaluate the result and talk about this way and this feature, and point out some
keys. in this way we would change in 3 days, not 3 weeks. It takes less time but
more effitioncy work.</p>

<p><strong>6. Focusing on 1 or 2 technologies, not 100.</strong> I like technology, I spent a lot
of on internet to find what&#8217;s newest language, what&#8217;s the best framework,
something like that. but finally I find that, I don&#8217;t know the very basic thing
of the language which I use everyday. everytime I need to find api docs to check
how to use the method, even I have used it for 10 times. If you are people like
me, stop searching on internet about the coolest technology, you can do this
before you sleep, take half an hour to do this, but not 4 hours everyday.
Focusing the technology you use everyday, know the basic and advanced, it can
help you work more efficency, and fix problems easily.</p>

<p><strong>7. Do something which is not related your work and technology.</strong> I love
technology, so I spent a lot of time on it, and sometime I got headache. Some
pelple say people who don&#8217;t know how to take rest, they don&#8217;t know how to work.
So read a book which is related to your work, or do some sports after work. This
is really releated to your habits, bacause some people really don&#8217;t need &#8220;rest&#8221;.</p>

<p>This post is not very realted to technology, but when you start think about any
of the above points, you are starting to be a better coder. because although we
work as a coder, half of the work is not writing code, they are manageing,
planning, thinking, communicating and writing code. If you are stucked by your
work, don&#8217;t know how to improve yourself, please think about other points.</p>
