I have learned ruby and rails for 1 year and 4 months. I collected a lot of great resources about ruby and rails from internet, it could be helpeful for you to start learning ruby and rails.

## Ruby Language

#### Books

The best book to start learning ruby is **Programming Ruby**

![programming ruby](http://img3.douban.com/mpic/s5616673.jpg)

This book tells everything about basic ruby language, it's very good to start.

As ruby has its own style to code, another very good book to learn ruby style is **Eloquent Ruby**

![Eloquent Ruby](http://img3.douban.com/mpic/s4683957.jpg)

and to learn what makes **Rails**, you need to know the **Meta Programming**, the best book for this area is **Metaprogramming Ruby**

#### RVM

[RVM](rvm.io) is a tool to install different rubies in a same computer, whenver you wanna switch to another version, you can do that very easily by using RVM.

#### Rubygems

Rubygems are the package of ruby code, just like **jar** in Java. It's a must learning tool. You can just browse the offical website of [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org), and check the [offical documentation](http://guides.rubygems.org/), and learn how to [write your own ruby gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/)

#### Bundler

[Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) is great tool to manage gem dependencies. It means you have lots of gems in a ruby project, and different gems dependend on other different version gems, bundler can help manage that, it's a little like **Maven** in Java. **Using bundler, it's more easy to start a ruby gem, check the link to know how to do that**, [create gem by using bundler](http://gembundler.com/rubygems.html)

#### RSpec

The best testing framework in ruby, after using it, you will love it. check the link [RSpec](rspec.info) 

_The above are the basic knowledge which make the ruby world so exciting, after you know all of this, it's much more easier to start exploring things in the ruby world_

## Rails

#### The best resource to start learning rails

[Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) is always the best resource to start learning rails, and lots books just copy the content here. So before you finish that, you don't need any other resource.

#### Railscasts

[Railscasts](http://www.railscasts.com) is very good resource for people to learn rails, the quality is great, you need check all of them.

#### Books

There are some books for the specific topics in Rails.

**Views**  [The Rails View: Create a Beautiful and Maintainable User Experience](http://pragprog.com/book/warv/the-rails-view)

![The Rails View](http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/233/warv_xlargecover.jpg?1331645481)

**Recipes**  [Rails Recipes: Rails 3 Edition](http://pragprog.com/book/rr2/rails-recipes)

![Rails Recipes](http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/239/rr2_xlargecover.jpg?1300128814)

**Deploying**  [Deploying Rails: Automate, Deploy, Scale, Maintain, and Sleep at Night](http://pragprog.com/book/cbdepra/deploying-rails)

![Deploying Rails](http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/246/cbdepra_xlargecover.jpg?1331155494)

_Until now, the resources are the traditional resources, reading the official documentation and reading some books, There are some other more advanced way to learn ruby and rails_

## Keep tracking the new knowledge of the community

Here I introduce 2 podcasts, In the podcast you can always get what is happening in the ruby and rails community, new technology or new gems, most of the time, you need them, maybe a gem can help you, maybe a new trick can help you. here are the links

1. [The Ruby Show](http://rubyshow.com/)
2. [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com)

## Stackoverflow

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is a friend of the coder's. One day, I think stackoverflow is a great place to learn things, it's not only questions, but try to answer others questions, to kown whether you can solve the problems is really good way to improve yourself, because all the problems people meet you may meet in the future. So you can subscribe the **Ruby** and **Ruby On Rails** topics, try to answer some questions.

## Github

People from Ruby and Rails community love [Github](http://github.com), because it's built with Rails, and it's a great tool to share code, manage code by using **Git**. But another very good thing in github is **exploring**, Here the link [explore](https://github.com/explore), you can choose [Languages](https://github.com/languages), and select [Ruby](https://github.com/languages/Ruby) to check the hottest ruby repository code, and learn from the code.

## Ruby Toolbox

[Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) is a great tool to choose Rubygems. For example, you wanna a cms framework, you don't need google but ruby toolbox. I think here you can find the best gem in every categories, the best cms framework, the best deployment gem, the best testing framework and so on.

## Ruby weekly newsletter

[Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) is a weekly newsletter about infomation from Ruby and Rails community, you'll find great tool or tricks every week.

## Ruby Blogs

[Ruby Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com/). People only talk about Ruby and Rails here. A lot of more **advanced** topic, such as deployment, performance, cloud and so on.

[Ruby Source](http://rubysource.com/). Here is another blog, It talks about more tricks which could be used in your project.
